"""
This library implements scoped taskgroups.

Large(r) programs consist of building blocks which depend on each other.
Crucially, these blocks may get started in FIFO order: the main program
starts a mid-level support task which starts a low-level connection.
In order to cleanly terminate this, the main program must be cancelled
first.

Those building blocks and their dependencies typically form a DAG. However,
we're not concerned with keeping as much of the support code running after
the main program has ended. Thus a linear ordering is sufficient.

Usage:

Wrap your main async code with ``async with main_scope(): ...``.

Start a service task (i.e. something you depend on) with
``asyncscope.spawn_service``. Start a subtask which should run in parallel
and which you're going to wait on with ``asyncscope.spawn``.

Scope objects are handled in the background, though you are free to
create one.
